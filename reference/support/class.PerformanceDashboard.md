# PerformanceDashboard Class

## Entity Classification & Context
- **Kind:** Class
- **Scope:** Module-level
- **Module:** __main__ (reference-server.py)
- **Purpose:** Real-time performance monitoring dashboard

## Complete Signature & Definition
```python
class PerformanceDashboard:
    """Real-time performance monitoring dashboard"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.execution_history = []
        self.system_metrics = []
        self.dashboard_lock = threading.Lock()
        self.max_history = 1000
```

## Purpose & Behavior
Real-time performance monitoring and analytics system providing:
- **Execution Tracking:** Command execution history with performance metrics
- **System Metrics Collection:** Real-time system performance data
- **Performance Analytics:** Success rates, execution times, and trend analysis
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Comprehensive performance summary and statistics

## Dependencies & Usage
- **Depends on:**
  - threading.Lock for synchronization
  - time module for timestamp tracking
  - typing.Dict, Any for type annotations
- **Used by:**
  - EnhancedProcessManager for execution tracking
  - Performance monitoring systems
  - System analytics and reporting

## Implementation Details

### Core Attributes
- **execution_history:** Command execution history list
- **system_metrics:** System performance metrics list
- **dashboard_lock:** Thread synchronization lock
- **max_history:** Maximum history entries (1000)

### Key Methods

#### Performance Tracking
1. **record_execution(command: str, result: Dict[str, Any]):** Record command execution for performance tracking
2. **update_system_metrics(metrics: Dict[str, Any]):** Update system metrics for dashboard
3. **get_summary() -> Dict[str, Any]:** Get comprehensive performance summary

### Execution Recording

#### Execution Record Structure
```python
{
    "command": str,                 # Command (truncated to 100 chars)
    "success": bool,                # Execution success status
    "execution_time": float,        # Execution duration in seconds
    "return_code": int,             # Process return code
    "timestamp": float              # Execution timestamp
}
```

#### Recording Process
1. **Command Truncation:** Long commands truncated to 100 characters
2. **Result Extraction:** Extract key metrics from execution result
3. **History Management:** Add to history with size limit enforcement
4. **Thread Safety:** All operations protected by lock

### System Metrics Management

#### Metrics Collection
- **Real-time Updates:** Continuous system metrics collection
- **Historical Storage:** Maintain metrics history for trend analysis
- **Size Management:** Automatic cleanup of old metrics (max 1000 entries)

#### Metrics Structure
- **Flexible Format:** Accepts any metrics dictionary structure
- **Timestamp Integration:** Automatic timestamp tracking
- **Thread-safe Storage:** Protected concurrent access

### Performance Summary Analytics

#### Summary Calculation
- **Recent Focus:** Analyze last 100 executions for current performance
- **Success Rate:** Calculate percentage of successful executions
- **Average Execution Time:** Mean execution time across recent executions
- **Total Statistics:** Overall execution count and metrics count

#### Summary Output Structure
```python
{
    "total_executions": int,            # Total execution count in history
    "recent_executions": int,           # Recent executions analyzed (last 100)
    "success_rate": float,              # Success rate percentage (0-100)
    "avg_execution_time": float,        # Average execution time in seconds
    "system_metrics_count": int         # Number of system metrics collected
}
```

#### Analytics Algorithm
```python
recent_executions = self.execution_history[-100:]  # Last 100 executions
total_executions = len(recent_executions)
successful_executions = sum(1 for e in recent_executions if e["success"])
avg_execution_time = sum(e["execution_time"] for e in recent_executions) / total_executions
success_rate = (successful_executions / total_executions * 100) if total_executions > 0 else 0
```

### History Management

#### Size Limitation
- **Maximum Entries:** 1000 entries for both execution history and system metrics
- **FIFO Cleanup:** Remove oldest entries when limit exceeded
- **Memory Efficiency:** Prevent unbounded memory growth

#### History Cleanup Algorithm
```python
self.execution_history.append(execution_record)
if len(self.execution_history) > self.max_history:
    self.execution_history.pop(0)  # Remove oldest entry
```

### Thread Safety and Synchronization

#### Lock Protection
- **Dashboard Lock:** Single lock protects all dashboard data
- **Atomic Operations:** All data modifications are atomic
- **Concurrent Access:** Safe concurrent access from multiple threads

#### Thread-safe Operations
- **Record Execution:** Thread-safe execution recording
- **Update Metrics:** Thread-safe system metrics updates
- **Get Summary:** Thread-safe summary calculation

### Performance Metrics

#### Execution Performance
- **Success Rate Tracking:** Monitor command execution success rates
