### Attack Chain Discovery

#### Chain Discovery Process
1. **Target Analysis:** Analyze target software for vulnerability patterns
2. **Initial Access:** Find remote execution vulnerabilities for initial access
3. **Privilege Escalation:** Identify privilege escalation opportunities
4. **Persistence:** Locate persistence mechanisms
5. **Probability Calculation:** Calculate overall chain success probability
6. **Recommendation Generation:** Generate tactical recommendations

#### Chain Structure
```python
{
    "chain_id": str,                    # Unique chain identifier
    "target": str,                      # Target software
    "stages": List[Dict[str, Any]],     # Attack stages
    "overall_probability": float,       # Overall success probability
    "complexity": str                   # Chain complexity rating
}
```

#### Stage Structure
```python
{
    "stage": int,                       # Stage number
    "objective": str,                   # Stage objective
    "vulnerability": Dict[str, Any],    # Vulnerability details
    "success_probability": float        # Stage success probability
}
```

### Chain Generation Algorithm

#### Multi-stage Chain Building
1. **Initial Access Stage:** Find remote execution vulnerabilities
2. **Privilege Escalation Stage:** Add privilege escalation if available
3. **Persistence Stage:** Add persistence mechanisms if within depth limit
4. **Probability Calculation:** Multiply stage probabilities for overall probability

#### Probability Calculation
```python
chain["overall_probability"] *= stage_probability
```

#### Depth Limiting
- **Maximum Depth:** Configurable maximum chain depth (default: 3)
- **Stage Limiting:** Prevent chains from becoming too complex
- **Practical Focus:** Focus on achievable attack chains

### Vulnerability Pattern Matching

#### Mock Vulnerability Database
```python
mock_vulnerabilities = [
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2024-1234",
        "description": f"Remote code execution in {software}",
        "cvss_score": 9.8,
        "exploitability": "HIGH"
    },
    {
        "cve_id": "CVE-2024-5678",
        "description": f"Privilege escalation in {software}",
        "cvss_score": 7.8,
        "exploitability": "MEDIUM"
    }
]
```

#### Pattern Matching Logic
- **Keyword Matching:** Match vulnerability descriptions to attack patterns
- **Software Context:** Consider software-specific vulnerabilities
- **Exploitability Assessment:** Include exploitability ratings

### Chain Recommendations

#### Recommendation Generation
- **Chain Count:** Total number of viable attack chains found
- **Probability Analysis:** Highest probability chain identification
- **Tactical Guidance:** Strategic recommendations for chain execution

#### Recommendation Structure
```python
[
    f"Found {len(chains)} potential attack chains",
    f"Highest probability chain: {max_probability:.2%}",
    "Recommendations:",
    "- Test chains in order of probability",
    "- Prepare fallback methods for each stage",
    "- Consider detection evasion at each stage"
]
```

### Success Probability Modeling

#### Stage Probabilities
- **Initial Access:** 0.75 (75% success probability)
- **Privilege Escalation:** 0.60 (60% success probability)
- **Persistence:** 0.80 (80% success probability)

#### Overall Probability
- **Multiplicative Model:** Overall probability = Stage1 × Stage2 × Stage3
- **Realistic Assessment:** Accounts for cumulative failure risk
- **Decision Support:** Helps prioritize attack chains

### Complexity Assessment

#### Complexity Ratings
- **LOW:** Single-stage attacks
- **MEDIUM:** Multi-stage attacks with 2-3 stages
- **HIGH:** Complex multi-stage attacks with 4+ stages

#### Complexity Factors
- **Stage Count:** Number of attack stages
- **Dependency Complexity:** Inter-stage dependencies
- **Technical Difficulty:** Technical skill requirements

### Error Handling and Resilience

#### Exception Handling
- **Comprehensive Catching:** Handle all exceptions during chain discovery
- **Error Result Structure:** Structured error response format
- **Logging Integration:** Error logging for troubleshooting

#### Fallback Behavior
- **Empty Chain Handling:** Graceful handling when no chains found
- **Partial Results:** Return partial results when possible
- **Graceful Degradation:** Continue operation despite individual failures

### Output Structure

#### Successful Chain Discovery
```python
{
    "success": True,
    "target_software": str,             # Target software analyzed
    "total_chains": int,                # Number of chains found
    "attack_chains": List[Dict],        # Detailed attack chains
    "recommendation": str               # Strategic recommendations
}
```

#### Failed Chain Discovery

    "success": False,
    "error": str                        # Error description
