  - typing.Dict, Any, List for type annotations
  - Team skill profiles and challenge data
- **Used by:**
  - CTF competition management systems
  - Team strategy optimization
  - Challenge assignment workflows

## Implementation Details

### Core Attributes
- **team_members:** Team member profiles and capabilities
- **challenge_assignments:** Current challenge assignment tracking
- **team_communication:** Team communication and coordination logs
- **shared_resources:** Shared tools, knowledge, and resources

### Key Methods

#### Team Strategy Management
1. **optimize_team_strategy(challenges: List[CTFChallenge], team_skills: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:** Main strategy optimization
2. **_estimate_solve_time(challenge: CTFChallenge, member_skills: Dict[str, bool]) -> int:** Solve time estimation
3. **_assign_challenges_optimally(member_challenge_scores: Dict[str, List[Dict]]) -> Dict[str, List[Dict]]:** Optimal assignment algorithm
4. **_identify_collaboration_opportunities(challenges: List[CTFChallenge], team_skills: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:** Collaboration detection

### Team Strategy Optimization Framework

#### Strategy Output Structure
```python
{
    "assignments": Dict[str, List[Dict]],           # Member-to-challenge assignments
    "priority_queue": List[Dict],                   # Prioritized challenge queue
    "collaboration_opportunities": List[Dict],      # Team collaboration recommendations
    "resource_sharing": Dict[str, Any],            # Shared resource allocation
    "estimated_total_score": int,                  # Projected team score
    "time_allocation": Dict[str, int]              # Time allocation per member
}
```

### Skill Matrix Analysis

#### Skill Categories (7 CTF Domains)
- **Web Application Security:** "web", "webapp"
- **Cryptography:** "crypto", "cryptography"
- **Binary Exploitation:** "pwn", "binary"
- **Digital Forensics:** "forensics", "investigation"
- **Reverse Engineering:** "reverse", "reversing"
- **Open Source Intelligence:** "osint", "intelligence"
- **Miscellaneous:** Universal capability (all members)

#### Skill Matching Algorithm
```python
skill_matrix[member] = {
    "web": "web" in skills or "webapp" in skills,
    "crypto": "crypto" in skills or "cryptography" in skills,
    "pwn": "pwn" in skills or "binary" in skills,
    "forensics": "forensics" in skills or "investigation" in skills,
    "rev": "reverse" in skills or "reversing" in skills,
    "osint": "osint" in skills or "intelligence" in skills,
    "misc": True  # Everyone can handle miscellaneous challenges
}
```

### Challenge Scoring System

#### Base Score Calculation
- **Starting Point:** Challenge point value
- **Skill Multiplier:** 1.5x bonus for relevant skill match
- **Difficulty Penalty:** Adjusted based on challenge difficulty

#### Difficulty Penalty Matrix
- **Easy:** 1.0 (no penalty)
- **Medium:** 0.9 (10% penalty)
- **Hard:** 0.7 (30% penalty)
- **Insane:** 0.5 (50% penalty)
- **Unknown:** 0.8 (20% penalty)

#### Final Score Formula
```
final_score = base_score × skill_multiplier × difficulty_penalty
```

### Time Estimation System

#### Base Time Estimates (by Difficulty)
- **Easy:** 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
- **Medium:** 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- **Hard:** 7200 seconds (2 hours)
- **Insane:** 14400 seconds (4 hours)
- **Unknown:** 5400 seconds (1.5 hours)

#### Skill-based Time Optimization
- **Relevant Skill Match:** 30% time reduction (0.7x multiplier)
- **No Skill Match:** Standard time estimate

### Challenge Assignment Algorithm

#### Greedy Assignment Strategy
1. **Score Calculation:** Calculate member-challenge compatibility scores
2. **Best Match Selection:** Iteratively select highest-scoring assignments
3. **Conflict Resolution:** Ensure each challenge assigned to only one member
4. **Assignment Tracking:** Maintain assignment state and prevent duplicates

#### Assignment Process
- **Iteration:** Continue until all challenges assigned or no valid assignments remain
- **Optimization:** Maximizes total team score through optimal assignments
- **Fairness:** Distributes workload based on member capabilities

### Priority Queue Generation

#### Priority Factors
- **Challenge Score:** Member-challenge compatibility score
- **Estimated Time:** Solve time prediction
- **Member Assignment:** Assigned team member
- **Challenge Identifier:** Challenge name and details

#### Queue Sorting
- **Primary Sort:** Descending priority score (highest first)
- **Secondary Sort:** Ascending estimated time (faster first)
- **Tertiary Sort:** Member availability and workload

### Collaboration Opportunity Detection

#### Collaboration Criteria
- **High Difficulty:** Hard or Insane difficulty challenges
- **Multiple Experts:** 2+ team members with relevant skills
- **Skill Complementarity:** Different but complementary skill sets

#### Collaboration Recommendations
```python
{
    "challenge": str,                    # Challenge name
    "recommended_team": List[str],       # Recommended team members
    "reason": str                        # Collaboration rationale
}
```

#### Collaboration Benefits
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Combined expertise and experience
- **Parallel Approaches:** Multiple solution strategies simultaneously
- **Quality Assurance:** Peer review and validation
- **Learning Opportunity:** Skill transfer between team members

### Team Coordination Features

#### Resource Management
- **Shared Tools:** Common tool access and coordination
- **Knowledge Base:** Shared findings and insights
- **Communication Logs:** Team coordination history
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time challenge progress monitoring

#### Performance Optimization
- **Load Balancing:** Even workload distribution across team
- **Skill Development:** Opportunities for skill growth and learning
- **Efficiency Maximization:** Optimal time and resource utilization
- **Score Maximization:** Strategic focus on high-value challenges
