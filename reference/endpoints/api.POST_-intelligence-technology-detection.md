- **Method:** POST
- **Path:** /api/intelligence/technology-detection
- **Content-Type:** application/json

### Request Body
```json
{
    "target": "string"          // Required: Target to analyze (IP, domain, URL)
}
```

### Parameters
- **target:** Target to analyze for technology detection (required)

## Response

### Success Response (200 OK)
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "target": "example.com",
    "detected_technologies": ["wordpress", "php", "nginx"],
    "cms_type": "WordPress",
    "technology_recommendations": {
        "WordPress": {
            "tools": ["wpscan", "nuclei"],
            "focus_areas": ["plugin vulnerabilities", "theme issues", "user enumeration"],
            "priority": "high"
        },
        "PHP": {
            "tools": ["nikto", "sqlmap", "ffuf"],
            "focus_areas": ["code injection", "file inclusion", "SQL injection"],
            "priority": "high"
        }
    },
    "target_profile": {
        "target_type": "web_application",
        "technologies": ["wordpress", "php"],
        "cms_type": "WordPress",
        "confidence": 0.95
    },
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Response (500 Internal Server Error)
```json
{
    "error": "Server error: {error_message}"
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Technology Detection Process
1. **Target Analysis:** Use IntelligentDecisionEngine to analyze target
2. **Technology Identification:** Extract detected technologies from profile
3. **Recommendation Generation:** Generate technology-specific recommendations
4. **Priority Assignment:** Assign priority levels based on technology risk

### Technology-Specific Recommendations (3 Technologies)

#### WordPress Recommendations
```json
{
    "tools": ["wpscan", "nuclei"],
    "focus_areas": ["plugin vulnerabilities", "theme issues", "user enumeration"],
    "priority": "high"
}
```

#### PHP Recommendations
```json
{
    "tools": ["nikto", "sqlmap", "ffuf"],
    "focus_areas": ["code injection", "file inclusion", "SQL injection"],
    "priority": "high"
}
```

#### Node.js Recommendations
```json
{
    "tools": ["nuclei", "ffuf"],
    "focus_areas": ["prototype pollution", "dependency vulnerabilities"],
    "priority": "medium"
}
```

### Technology Mapping Logic
```python
for tech in profile.technologies:
    if tech == TechnologyStack.WORDPRESS:
        # WordPress-specific recommendations
    elif tech == TechnologyStack.PHP:
        # PHP-specific recommendations
    elif tech == TechnologyStack.NODEJS:
        # Node.js-specific recommendations
```

### Decision Engine Integration
- **Profile Analysis:** profile = decision_engine.analyze_target(target)
- **Technology Extraction:** Extract technologies from target profile
- **CMS Detection:** Include CMS type information
- **Confidence Scoring:** Include confidence levels from analysis

### Recommendation Structure

#### Tool Recommendations
- **Specific Tools:** List of recommended security tools for each technology
- **Technology Focus:** Tools selected based on technology-specific vulnerabilities
- **Testing Efficiency:** Optimize tool selection for technology stack

#### Focus Areas
- **Vulnerability Categories:** Specific vulnerability types to focus on
- **Technology Risks:** Known risks associated with each technology
- **Testing Priorities:** Prioritized testing areas for maximum impact

#### Priority Levels
- **High Priority:** Critical technologies requiring immediate attention
- **Medium Priority:** Important technologies with moderate risk
- **Low Priority:** Supporting technologies with lower risk profile

## AuthN/AuthZ
- **Authentication:** Not specified (appears to be open)
- **Authorization:** Technology detection access required

## Observability
- **Detection Logging:** Log technology detection initiation and completion
- **Analysis Logging:** Log target analysis and technology identification
- **Result Logging:** Log detected technologies and recommendations

## Use Cases and Applications

#### Security Assessment
- **Technology Profiling:** Profile target technologies for security assessment
- **Risk Assessment:** Assess technology-specific security risks
- **Testing Strategy:** Develop technology-focused testing strategies

#### Penetration Testing
- **Reconnaissance:** Technology reconnaissance for penetration testing
