# HexStrike AI - Installation Script Upgrade Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive upgrade of the `setup.sh` script from version 2.0.0 to 3.0.0, transforming it into a production-grade, idempotent, and cross-platform installation system.

## Executive Summary
- **Scope**: Complete audit and upgrade of setup.sh for production use
- **Platforms Added**: macOS support via Homebrew
- **Tools Covered**: 85+ security tools plus 16 system dependencies
- **Key Improvements**: Idempotency, error handling, cross-platform support, comprehensive documentation

## Major Changes

### 1. Production-Grade Shell Options
**Change**: Added `set -euo pipefail` at script start
**Rationale**: Ensures fail-fast behavior and prevents silent failures
**Impact**: Script now exits immediately on any error, undefined variable, or pipe failure
**Source**: [Bash Best Practices](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#The-Set-Builtin)

### 2. macOS Support Implementation
**Change**: Added comprehensive macOS detection and Homebrew support
**Files Modified**: 
- `detect_distro()` function enhanced to detect macOS
- `get_package_manager()` function updated with Homebrew support
- `get_package_name()` function expanded with macOS package mappings

**New Functionality**:
```bash
# macOS detection
if [[ "$OSTYPE" == "darwin"* ]]; then
    DISTRO="macos"
    PKG_MANAGER="brew"
fi
```

**Package Mappings Added**:
- `build-essential` → `xcode-select --install`
- `python3-dev` → `python3`
- `libssl-dev` → `openssl`
- `golang-go` → `go`

**Sources**: 
- [Homebrew Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/)
- [Homebrew Formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/)

### 3. System Dependencies Addition
**Change**: Added 16 critical system dependencies to tool database
**New Dependencies**:
- `build-essential` - Essential build tools
- `python3-dev` - Python development headers
- `python3-pip` - Python package installer
- `golang-go` - Go programming language
- `libssl-dev` - SSL/TLS development libraries
- `libffi-dev` - Foreign Function Interface library
- `libpq-dev` - PostgreSQL client library
- `zlib1g-dev` - Compression library
- `pkg-config` - Package configuration system
- `cmake` - Cross-platform build system
- `curl` - Data transfer tool
- `wget` - Network downloader
- `git` - Version control system
- `unzip` - Archive extraction utility
- `ca-certificates` - SSL certificate bundle
- `software-properties-common` - Software properties management

**Rationale**: These dependencies are required for compiling and installing many security tools from source
**Source**: Analysis of tool compilation requirements and Docker best practices

### 4. Enhanced Idempotency Checks
**Change**: Improved `check_tool()` function with package-specific verification
**Before**: Only used `command -v` for basic command availability
**After**: Added comprehensive checks:
- `dpkg -s` for Debian/Ubuntu packages
- `brew list` for macOS packages
- Python package import verification
- Common installation path checking

**Implementation**:
```bash
case $PKG_MANAGER in
    "apt")
        if dpkg -s "$package_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            # Package is installed
        fi
        ;;
    "brew")
        if brew list "$package_name" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
            # Package is installed
        fi
        ;;
esac
```

**Impact**: Prevents unnecessary reinstallation attempts and provides accurate status reporting

### 5. Non-Interactive Installation Flags
**Change**: Added `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` and `-y` flags consistently
**Before**: Some commands could prompt for user input
**After**: All package manager commands use non-interactive flags
**Example**: `sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y`
**Rationale**: Essential for CI/CD environments and automated deployments

### 6. Cross-Platform Package Name Mappings
**Change**: Comprehensive package name mapping for all supported platforms
**Scope**: 70+ tools mapped across Ubuntu/Debian, Fedora/RHEL, Arch, and macOS
**Examples**:
- `theharvester` → `theHarvester` (Fedora/RHEL)
- `evil-winrm` → `rubygem-evil-winrm` (Fedora/RHEL)
- `exiftool` → `libimage-exiftool-perl` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- `xxd` → `vim-common` (Fedora/RHEL)

**Research Sources**:
- [Ubuntu Package Search](https://packages.ubuntu.com/)
- [Fedora Package Database](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/)
- [Arch Package Search](https://archlinux.org/packages/)
- [Homebrew Formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/)

### 7. Installation Command Generation
**Change**: Updated installation commands with proper system dependencies
**macOS Commands**:
```bash
# System dependencies
xcode-select --install
brew install openssl libffi libpq zlib pkg-config cmake curl wget git unzip ca-certificates python3 python3-pip go

# Security tools
brew install nmap masscan amass subfinder nuclei gobuster ffuf dirb nikto sqlmap wpscan zaproxy hydra john hashcat medusa gdb radare2 binwalk ghidra volatility3 exiftool xxd

```

### 8. Error Handling Improvements
**Change**: Enhanced error handling throughout the script
**Additions**:
- Proper exit codes for all functions
- Comprehensive logging with timestamps
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies
- Clear error messages with suggested remediation

### 9. Version Updates
**Change**: Updated script version from 2.0.0 to 3.0.0
**Date**: Updated last modified date to 2025-08-22
**Rationale**: Major version bump reflects significant architectural changes
